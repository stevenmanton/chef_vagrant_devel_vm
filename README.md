To get started, first install Chef-DK. Then, I used Berkshelf to initialize the directory so it can manage 3rd party cookbooks. It's also helpful to install the corresponding vagrant-berkshelf plugin. Also, install the vagrant-omnibus plugin so that the guest VM has the most up-do-date version of Chef.
